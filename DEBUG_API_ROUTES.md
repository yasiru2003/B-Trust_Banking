# 🔍 Debug API Routes Issue

## ❌ **Current Problem:**
Still getting "Route not found" error even after fixing route order.

## 🔧 **Additional Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Fixed 404 Handler**
Changed from:
```javascript
app.use('*', (req, res) => { ... }); // Too broad - catches everything
```
To:
```javascript
app.use('/api/*', (req, res) => { ... }); // Only catches API routes
```

### 2. **Added Debug Logging**
Added console logs to track route registration:
```javascript
console.log('🔗 Registering API routes...');
// ... route registrations ...
console.log('✅ API routes registered successfully');
```

### 3. **Added Test API Endpoint**
Added `/api/test` endpoint to verify API is working:
```javascript
app.get('/api/test', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'API is working',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test API Endpoint**
Visit: `https://b-trust.onrender.com/api/test`
Expected: `{"success": true, "message": "API is working"}`

### **Step 2: Test Health Check**
Visit: `https://b-trust.onrender.com/health`
Expected: `{"status": "OK", ...}`

### **Step 3: Test Login Endpoint**
POST to: `https://b-trust.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
Expected: Should reach the auth route (not 404)

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**

After redeploy, check the Render logs for:
- `🔗 Registering API routes...`
- `✅ API routes registered successfully`
- Any error messages during route registration

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

The API routes should now work correctly. If `/api/test` works but `/api/auth/login` still fails, there might be an issue with the specific auth route implementation.

**Redeploy and test the `/api/test` endpoint first!** 🚀
